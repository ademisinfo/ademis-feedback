Ademis Feedback is a library aiming to provide an in-app user bug tracker tool. It provides the same
service as Usersnap, but is Open-Source, self-hosted and much more customizable.

Ademis Feedback let the users of your application explain their issues directly in the website:
a small button is added in a corner of the website, the user can click on it to describe its problem
and send a report to a specific URL.

Ademis Feedback also support screenshots and screenshots editing by the user so s/he can explains in a
visual way what bother them.

Each report sent by Ademis Feedback also includes the context of execution of the user: what browser s/he
uses, what plugins are installed, what is the HTML when the problem occured, etc.

The options of the library let you customize everything: you can choose how and where to send the reports,
how the button should look, whether the users can edit their screenshots or not, etc.
